# Money Assistant

Money assistant is an app created to help those who struggle to count money who wish to operate a register.

The app assumes that the user is the operator of a well stocked standard cash register containing bills (\$1, \$5, \$10, \$20) and change (1￠, 5￠, 10￠, 25￠)

The interface was designed to be intuitive and only show what is necessary in order to avoid being distracting or confusing. 

The first page the user will see allows them to enter in the cost of the product they are selling to the customer

Next, Once the change has been entered, A selection screen will appear where the user will select the change that they were given. To select change, they will click the right side (highlighted in green) to add a bill, or the left side (highlighted in red) to remove in the case they have accidentally clicked something incorrectly.

Finally, once all of the money has been handed over, the app will display the change necessary to give back if any.
